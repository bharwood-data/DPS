# Bias Simulation Files

This folder contains the source files for conducting bias simulation experiments in [insert project/research name].

## Overview

The bias simulation files are part of a research project aimed at studying the effects of various biases on [describe the system or phenomenon being studied]. The simulations allow researchers to model different types of biases, such as self-selection bias and status quo bias, and analyze their impact on the outcomes of interest.

## Contents

- **outlier.py**: This module contains functions for introducing outlier bias and missing data in Markov chain simulations, as well as estimating the transition matrix and comparing to the original matrix.
- **polarization.py**: This script implements functions to simulate polarization scenarios and append results to shared lists. It introduces missing data unbiased on state polarization, calculates KL divergence and inaccuracy, and appends results after each run.
- **popularity.py**: This script implements functions to simulate popularity bias. It introduces missing data unbiased on state popularity, estimate the transition matrix and compares to the original.
- **status_quo.py**: This module contains functions to simulate status quo bias in Markov Chains, introducing missing data and self-selection bias, estimating the transition matrix and comparing to the original.
- **unbiased.py**: This module contains functions for simulating unbiased Markov chains with missing data, also introducing self-selection bias, estimating the transition matrix and comparing to the original.

## Usage

To use the bias simulation files, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the Bias Simulation Folder**: Open the folder containing the bias simulation files.
3. **Configure Parameters**: Modify the parameters in the simulation files according to your experiment setup and research objectives.
4. **Run the Simulations**: Execute the simulation files using the appropriate programming environment or tools.
5. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the output generated by the simulations to draw conclusions about the effects of biases on the system under study.

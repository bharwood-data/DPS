# Bias Simulation Files

This folder contains the source files for conducting bias simulation experiments. 

## Overview

The bias simulation files are part of a research project aimed at studying the effects of various biases on Markov chain transition probability estimation. The simulations allow researchers to model different types of biases, such as self-selection bias and status quo bias, and analyze their impact on the outcomes of interest. Each files produces a variety of simulations based on user provide agent, observation, and state counts, as well as different user-provided levels of missing data. The simulations generate biased Markov chain observations and extract the transition matrix based on the so-called "na&iuml;ve" approach:

$$p_{ij}=\frac{\eta_{ij}}{\sum_{j}{\eta_{ij}}}$$
where $\eta_{ij}$ is the number of times state $i$ is followed by state $j$. The estimated matrix is then compared to the matrix used to generate the data with both the Kullback divergence and a custom metric based on the Frobenius norm. The option to use the forward-algorithm for data imputation prior to estimationg is available, as is estimation via the EM-algorithm.

## Contents

- **outlier.py**: This module contains functions for introducing outlier bias and missing data in Markov chain simulations, as well as estimating the transition matrix and comparing to the original matrix.
- **polarization.py**: This script implements functions to simulate polarization scenarios and append results to shared lists. It introduces missing data unbiased on state polarization, calculates KL divergence and inaccuracy, and appends results after each run.
- **popularity.py**: This script implements functions to simulate popularity bias. It introduces missing data unbiased on state popularity, estimate the transition matrix and compares to the original.
- **status_quo.py**: This module contains functions to simulate status quo bias in Markov Chains, introducing missing data and self-selection bias, estimating the transition matrix and comparing to the original.
- **unbiased.py**: This module contains functions for simulating unbiased Markov chains with missing data, also introducing self-selection bias, estimating the transition matrix and comparing to the original.

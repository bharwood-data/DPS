# Markov Chains Bias Simulation Repository

This repository contains scripts and utilities for conducting bias simulation experiments with Markov chains.

## Overview

The Markov Chains Bias Simulation Repository is a collection of Python scripts and utilities developed for research purposes. The repository provides tools for simulating various biases in Markov chain transitions, generating biased Markov chain observations, estimating transition matrices, and analyzing the effects of biases on transition probability estimation.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for simulating different types of biases, such as outlier bias, polarization bias, popularity bias, status quo bias, and unbiased Markov chains with missing data.
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions used by the simulation scripts, including functions for generating transition matrices, handling missing data, and performing matrix operations.
- **Results**: Contains the results of bias simulation experiments, including data files, plots, and analysis notebooks.
